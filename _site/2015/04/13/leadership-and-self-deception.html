                    <p>This is a review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Self-Deception-Getting-Out-Box-ebook/dp/B00GUPYRUS">Leadership and Self-Deception: Getting Out of the Box</a> by The Arbinger Institute.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/leadership-and-self-deception.jpg" alt="cover"></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>You&#39;re &quot;in the box&quot; when you&#39;re viewing others around you as mere objects and not as people.</li>
<li>Other people respond primarily to how to see them, not how to act towards them.</li>
<li>Everyone is in the box towards some people, and outside of the box towards others, all the time.</li>
<li>You get in the box by not acting the way you know you should.</li>
<li>When you&#39;re inside the box, you <em>need</em> to feel justified, and can&#39;t focus on results. This is known as self deception.</li>
<li>This distorts how you see other people.</li>
<li>Over time, your boxes can become baggage that you bring to new relationships.</li>
<li>When you&#39;re in the box, you invite others to be in the box towards you.</li>
<li>Only seeing people as people AND stopping resisting them will get you out of the box.</li>
<li>Things that DON&#39;T get you out of the box: try to change them, cope with them, leave, change your behavior or even communicate better.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commentary</h2>

<p>The book is written in the form of a narrative of a fictional new employee at a fictional company, going through a training session on leadership. This is a somewhat surprising format for essentially a self-help/business/management book. But it works for me, I find it to make the subject matter easier to retain. It&#39;s also an easy read.</p>

<p>The concept of being &quot;in the box&quot;, is simultaneously intuitive in the broad strokes and counter-intuitive in the details. The key insight from my perspective is that you get in the box by betraying your own sense of how you should act in a given situation. I have found myself reflecting on this a lot since I read the book. It&#39;s also caused me to rethink some of my previous working relationships.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been trying to think of when I have been victim to self deception in the past. By the very nature of the problem, it&#39;s hard to know whether or to what extent you&#39;re effected. Perhaps it&#39;s best to focus on how to flag self deception in the future. Many corporate cultures have a mechanism for attempting to get this kind of feedback. Even so, I can&#39;t help but think that it&#39;s often not very effective. I will make a point in the future to explicitly ask people I work with how I am currently deceiving myself.</p>
