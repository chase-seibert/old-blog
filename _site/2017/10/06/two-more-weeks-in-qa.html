                    <p>Due to our regular QA engineer being out on vacation, I once again has the
opportunity to do a tour of duty in QA. This time, for a big mobile release.
I previously <a href="http://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2009/03/20/my-two-weeks-in-qa.html">wrote about a similar experience</a>
 eight (!) years ago, so I thought I would once again write down some reflections.</p>

<h1>Web vs Mobile</h1>

<p>Last time, I was testing a web product. This time, it was a mobile app. That
turned out to make a <strong>big difference</strong>. For one thing, I spent a lot more time
manually testing on various physical phones. Our app is on both Android and iOS,
so that&#39;s at least two devices for every test. But you also have to test on
older slower phones, phones on older versions of the operating system, etc. Plus
it&#39;s all via touch interfaces. It ends up being more time than testing web
features for a few browsers.</p>

<h1>More Documentation Time</h1>

<p>This time I spent a lot more time updating test plans. Because we have to test
on so many phones, we have an outsourced QA team for even more manual testing
horsepower. While I may test on five or six phones, I can send a test plan over
to a remote team to run it on fifteen to twenty phones.</p>

<p>The existing documentation turned out to be very useful. Not only did it remind
me about a bunch of test cases I would have forgotten about, but it had all kinds
of hints about the most efficient way to test a specific case.</p>

<h1>Communication</h1>

<p>Because it was a big release, I spent a bunch of time coming up with daily
reports of whether we were on track for launch. At a high level, I wanted to
communicate how many bugs we had, new bugs we had discovered that day, any
blockers for release and what step on our release schedule we were on.</p>

<p>But I also made some fun graphs!</p>

<h1>Triage &amp; Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>This time, I got more involved in triaging new bugs. Not just reproducing them
and writing a good bug report, but also setting priority. This turned out to
often involve discussions with both the product owner and the engineers. On more
than a few bugs, we decided that while the severity of the bug was low to medium,
we actually did not want to fix it now because we don&#39;t have a good solution that
doesn&#39;t involve a medium sized refactor.</p>

<p>Similarly, we ended up having a lot of conversations about how to be more
defensive in the code to prevent errors like the one in a particular bug report
more generically. Some of these were also not feasible/wise to take on
immediately. They went into the backlog.</p>

<h1>What Was the Same</h1>

<p>Once again, I was surprised my how many blocking issues I ran into just trying
to get a build running well enough to test. We have most of the kinks worked
out of our build pipeline, so there were not any problems getting a given
build onto a phone. But I was blocked for days at a time on things like third
party API integration staging environments being down. In one case, it took
way too much time to discover that the breakage was related to a new network
configuration in the office; we had forgotten to whitelist some IPs.</p>
