                    <p>I like to ask other managers what kind of questions they ask during their one on ones. Everyone has their own style, so I often get some interesting responses. Getting good information out of your one on one conversations is something of an art. Given the amount of time over a career that you will spend during one on ones, it&#39;s worth a small time investment to improve your skills.</p>

<h2>Managing Humans</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Schedule one-on-ones with direct reports, keep them on the same day and time, and never cancel them. - Lopp, Michael (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1430243147">Managing Humans</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book is commonly held up as the work of God when it comes to managing people. Here are my blatant crib notes of the text.</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with the question &quot;How are you?&quot;.</li>
<li>Your biggest job is to gauge mood.</li>
<li>Learn something from every one on one.</li>
<li>Status is not the point.</li>
<li>Three things that are working, three things that are not, what are we going to do about it?</li>
<li>Never cancel them, it sends a bad message.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you&#39;re stuck, Michael suggests some emergency topics.</p>

<ul>
<li>Prepared points - i.e. context items from GTD.</li>
<li>Mini performance review.</li>
<li>Your current disaster.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How is it going?</h2>

<p>This is a variation on &quot;How are you&quot;? This does lead to a status update most times, so you often need to redirect. It&#39;s important to lead with something that lets people talk about whatever they want.</p>

<h2>How do you feel about coming to work every day?</h2>

<p>More direct question to get at their mood/happiness.</p>

<h2>How do you feel about working on project X?</h2>

<p>Give the employee permission to say that they don&#39;t like their current project, as well as implicitly tell them that it&#39;s something we can change.</p>

<h2>How is it going working with person X?</h2>

<p>Is there some asshole that&#39;s bothering you? Maybe I can help.</p>

<h2>Who are your best friends at work?</h2>

<p>For some people, work friend ships are critical.</p>

<h2>Who are the top people outside the company who you want to work with again?</h2>

<p>We should try to hire them.</p>

<h2>What features would you add?</h2>

<p>Are you thinking about the long-term future of the software? I care about what you think!</p>

<h2>What could I be doing better?</h2>

<p>I try to ask this as often as I can, but often forget.</p>

<h2>How comfortable are you with uncertainty?</h2>

<p>i.e. - how much insight into the sausage making can you stomach? Is that
motivational for you, or counter-productive?</p>

<h2>Other ideas</h2>

<p>One thing I like to do is change the scenery of a one on one. Taking a walk outside is a great idea. I also like to do a one on one over lunch occasionally. On the other hand, you definitely want to be in a traditional conference room if you need to give hard feedback, or have a tough conversation.</p>

<h1>The Coaching Habit</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Habit-Less-Change-Forever/dp/0978440749">Recommended reading</a>.
The seven questions they recommend work well for one on ones, too:</p>

<ul>
<li>What&#39;s on your mind?</li>
<li>And what else?</li>
<li>What&#39;s the real challenge here for you?</li>
<li>What do you want?</li>
<li>How can I help?</li>
<li>If you&#39;re saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?</li>
<li>What was most useful for you?</li>
</ul>
