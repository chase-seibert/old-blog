It's inevitable as a manager that at some point, you will have to lay someone
off. I'm not taking about firing someone because they are not performing. I'm
talking about the company is laying off 15% of the workforce for financial
reasons, and you have to deliver the news. When it happens, remember that this
is fundamentally not about you. You likely did not have any input in who is being
let go. That doesn't matter. This is about the people who are losing their
jobs and how it effects them and their loved ones. It's also about how it
effects the rest of the team that has to pick up the pieces and move on.

This guide assumes that you are going to be the one laying off your employee.
If you're given that oppertunity, I suggest you take it. 

# Initial Shock

Don't be surprised if you don't learn about the layoffs until just before you
have to tell other people. There is no great way to co-ordinate a mass
termination, but you can imagine that controlling that information on a need to
know basis is important.

Don't freak out. Your team needs you. There are probably other managers who are
finding out at the same time you are. Go talk to them. Now is a good time to
capitalize on the relationships you're building all the time to try to bring
some stability to what's happening.

You also need to quickly figure out some important details. Who is being let go?
Do the effected individuals get severance? What about their health
care? Do they have stock options then can exercise? What is the consistent
message that you will presenting them about why this is happening?

# Come Up With a Plan

As a manager, part of your job in a layoff is to tell the same story as the
company is telling about why this is happening, and how the effected individuals
were selected. You never want to communicate, especially to the people being
laid off, that this was not your decision. You are going to be saying the same
things to many people and groups of people over the coming days. You need to
own that message, and make sure everyone hears the same thing.

Start by writing down what you are going to say. The HR department likely has
provided an official version as guidance. Hopefully it's not to impersonal.
Translate it into your own language. Decide what you want to emphasize. Common
points:

- This is effecting a lot of people.
- It's about financials, not performance.
- Thank them for their work.

For those being terminated, there will be some common logistical information.
For audiences of people still with the company, you want to bring it back to
the company vision and mission by the end. More on how to actually have both
types of conversations later.

Again, you may not have a lot of time to prepare. I suggest you use this time
to role play the termination conversation with someone else. If you have an HR
buddy, that would be good. An experienced manager who is also in the loop would
be good, too. Have them ask you hard questions as the employee. You're probably
worried about how the real employee will take it. It's not going to be as bad
as you think, but have the role player do their worst.

# Layoff Day

Don't put anything on the calendar. Schedule a room if you need to, but as early
as possible in the day, start pulling people you need to terminate in. As soon
as the first person is terminated, and likely before that, rumors will be
circulating about what is happening. You want to get all your people out of the
way as early as possible.

Then, you want to let the rest of the team know they are safe. Whether you are
being let go or not, nothing is worse than sitting around wondering if someone
is going to tap you on the shoulder. Remember, for the team that needs to carry
on after this layoff, how you handle today might be the most impactful thing
you do all year.

# The Termination Conversation

Look the person in the eye. Tell them right up front that the company is having
layoffs today and that unfortunately they are in the effected group. Tell them
that as of this moment, that they are no longer employed here. Tell them you're
sorry.

Then don't say anything for 10 seconds. You basic job from here on out is to
empathize, provide clarity about some logistics, and represent the company. When
they leave this room, you want them to feel they were afforded some respect in
a truly crappy situation.

Give them a chance to process. They will have questions. Hopefully you covered
them in role playing. Absolutely do not say this was not your decision, and that
if it were up to you, they would still be employed. Even if that is true, it was
your job as a manager to make them more successful. It doesn't cost you anything
to own that.

At the end, repeat to them what they need to do now. It's probably some form
of clean our their desk and go to HR to sign some papers. This is the part you
most likely have absolute clarity on from the company. You might want to say it
a few times; it's hard for anyone to process information in this situation.

# Hard Questions

The conversation will probably be far short of your imagined worst case
scenario. If things do go fully sideways, just try to optimize for empathy and
clarity.

More likely, you will get questions similar to these.

## Why me, specifically?

This is about company financials, not your performance.

## Why didn't you give me feedback earlier?

The layoffs were a decision that we had to make on a very short timeframe. I
simply thought we would have more time to work on those issues.

## I thought this team was a priority for the company?

It is, but we had to make cuts across the board.

## But, didn't we just hire more people?

Those hires are for different roles.

# Afterwards

The real hard part comes afterwards. You now have to bring together a bunch of
people who are hurting emotionally, help them pick up and pieces and move
forward. Luckily, this looks much more like what you need to do all the time
to be a good manager. It will be tough, but it's not as outside your wheelhouse
as actually laying people off.

My advice is to have one on ones with absolutely everyone. More often than you
think, and for longer than you think. Pay special attention to people who lost
their manager, or people who are working on different projects now, with
different people.

Make sure in all these conversations to bring it back to the company vision
and mission. Good luck.
