title: Django&#58; ditch objects.using() in favor of a per-view decorator to switch databases
tags: django

<p>
Django has a "multiple databases" feature that lets you read/write data from more than just the default database. I'm going to show you how to switch databases on a per-view level, rather than per-query with <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/multi-db/#manually-selecting-a-database">objects.using()</a>, or per-server by changing <a href='https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#database-routers'>DATABASE_ROUTERS</a>. 
</p>

<p>
First, some background. Let's look at how regular database routing works. It all starts with DATABASES in settings.py.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="python">
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'myapp',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
    },
    'standby': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'myapp',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Then, you configure a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/multi-db/#an-example">database router</a>. Here is an example that reads from one database and writes to another. Maybe standby is a read-replica of default.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="python">
class StandbyRouter(object):
    """A router to control all database operations on models in
    the website application"""

    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        return "standby"

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        return "default"

    def allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):
        return True

    def allow_syncdb(self, db, model):
        return None
</pre>

<p>
That's fine if you want ALL reads to go to the standby, but what if you only want to do this for some queries? In my situation, I wanted to off load long running queries specifically for reporting. Here is the standard syntax for querying from another server, assuming your router db_for_read() returns "default".
</p>

<pre name="code" class="python">
class UserProfile(models.Model):

    user = models.OneToOneField(User, editable=False, unique=True)

    @property
    def timecards(self):
        return Timecard.objects.filter(user=self.user, status='open')

def get_report_data(request):
    num_invoices = Invoices.objects.using("standby").filter(user=request.user).count()
    num_timecards = request.user.profile.timecards.count()
</pre>

<p>
Maybe you see the problem here already. The using method is fine as long as you're making the queries yourself at the top level inside get_report_data(). But what about the timecards model property? It will use the default database. Sure, I could repeat myself all over the place passing around a parameter for the current database, and having a using clause on every single query, but that sounds messy.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, I want to set the database for an entire view at a time. Here's one way to do it. First, I declare a new router that dynamically chooses a database based on a setting.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="python">
class SettingsRouter(object):
    """A router to control all database operations on models in
    the website application. Can be over-ridden on demand with a
    decorator on a view or a particular function:

    @thread_local(DB_OVERRIDE='report')
    def social_network_reach(request):

    This is more DRY than having a .using() on every query. It also
    means you don't have to pass a using parameter all over the place.

    """

    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        return get_thread_local('DB_FOR_READ_OVERRIDE', 'default')

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        return "default"

    def allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):
        return True

    def allow_syncdb(self, db, model):
        return None
</pre>

<p>
To pass the DB_FOR_READ_OVERRIDE variable down the stack with out manually passing it via method arguments, I'm setting a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html#threading.local">thread local variable</a>. This means that in a production setting, the variable will only be set in the context of the currently running request. Here is the decorator that does just that.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="python">
import threading
from functools import wraps


threadlocal = threading.local()


class thread_local(object):
    """ a decorator that wraps a function in a thread local definition block
    useful for passing variables down the stack w/o actually passing them
    examples: what database to read from, whether to cache queries, etc
    adapted from django.test.utils.override_settings

    Usage:

    @thread_local(SITE_NAME_SHORT='foobar')
    def override(request):
        ...

    """

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.options = kwargs

    def __enter__(self):
        for attr, value in self.options.items():
            print attr, value
            setattr(threadlocal, attr, value)

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        for attr in self.options.keys():
            setattr(threadlocal, attr, None)

    def __call__(self, test_func):

        @wraps(test_func)
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            # the thread_local class is also a context manager
            # which means it will call __enter__ and __exit__
            with self:
                return test_func(*args, **kwargs)

        return inner


def get_thread_local(attr, default=None):
    """ use this method from lower in the stack to get the value """
    return getattr(threadlocal, attr, default)
</pre>

<p>
Finally, here is the what it looks like to use the new thread local variable to scope all of the inner queries to the standby database.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="python">
@thread_local(DB_FOR_READ_OVERRIDE='standby')
def get_report_data(request):
    num_invoices = Invoices.objects.filter(user=request.user).count()
    num_timecards = request.user.profile.timecards.count()
</pre>

<p>

Edit: I originally implemented this with @override_settings, before realizing that it would not work in a threaded production environment.
