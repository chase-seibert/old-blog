"The reason that I joined those other startups -- and the reason that I more often work for startups than big companies -- is not about money. It's about pace of career development.
Everything on my resume that is interesting or exciting was done at a startup. Every big jump in skill and in compensation has been a result of that startup mentality. Who's fixing this? Me, I'm the only one here. Who's going to deal with the fallout of my poor architecture? Me, I'm the only one here. Who learned a hard lesson? Me.
I can only speak to the cogs side of the house (I'm devops or whatever they're calling us this week)."

The corollary to this is that startups are small enough that it’s easier to have an impact on the company itself, even when the impact on the world is smaller in absolute terms. Nothing I do is make or break for a large company, but when I worked at a startup, it felt like what we did could change the odds of the company surviving.

"Those of us who failed to thrive at Google are faced with some pretty serious questions about ourselves. Just seeing that other people ran into the same issues is a huge relief. Google is supposed to be some kind of Nirvana, so if you can’t be happy there how will you ever be happy? It’s supposed to be the ultimate font of technical resources, so if you can’t be productive there how will you ever be productive?"
