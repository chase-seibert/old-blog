                    <p>I&#39;ve been using a time tracking tool pretty consistently for the last year to
categorize all of my time spent at work. It started with wondering how much
time I was spending in meetings. Eventually I found that it was easier to keep
up with than I thought, so I just stuck with it. Looking back at the year, I
can see some interesting data.</p>

<h1>Toggl</h1>

<p>The primary tool I&#39;ve been using is <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>. It&#39;s a simple app that sits in you status bar and prompts you to start a timer for what you&#39;re currently working on,
if there isn&#39;t one running already.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>I eventually settled on five primary &quot;projects&quot; that my time is categorized under:
meetings, coding, 1:1s, writing and other. In the end, I did end up spending more
time in meetings than doing anything else.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl_year.png" alt="img"></p>

<h2>Other/GTD time</h2>

<p>Other eventually became just &quot;GTD&quot; time, which is short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">getting things done</a>.
It&#39;s usually the first block of time in the morning, right after I grab coffee.
It consists of processing all my todos and notes from the previous day. Some tasks
I just categorize and set a due date for. Other tasks I complete right then, if
they are quick. My time spent on this category over the course of the year was
pretty constant.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl_other.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>I have a whole <a href="http://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2015/05/01/omnifocus.html">separate blog post</a> on GTD, if you want to learn more.</p>

<h2>Writing time</h2>

<p>The amount of time I spend writing wiki pages, blog posts and longer emails also
stayed pretty constant over the year. If I had broken this down into blog time
and everything else, I would imagine that blogging is at most two hours a month.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl_writing.png" alt="img"></p>

<h2>Coding time</h2>

<p>Coding is the area that I expected to tail off dramatically, and I was not
disappointed. This year I went from managing a team of three and being very
hands on coding, to three teams with 12 total people. In the past, I&#39;ve noticed
that right when you get to 5 or 6 people, you basically cannot write code
anymore.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl_coding.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>April was a hackathon project that I spent way to much extra time on. October
was a major release that was all hands on deck. I spent a bunch of time
doing QA type stuff that I categorized as coding. Other than that, it&#39;s been a
very steady trend downwards.</p>

<h2>Meetings and 1:1s</h2>

<p>Meeting time was somewhat steady. I see a spike in March that was a bunch of
interviews, including a potential aquihire. There is another big spike in
September, which was getting a new boss, splitting up a team and also
a bunch of late project schedule coordination meetings.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggle_meetings.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>For one on ones, there was a steady increase as we added new team members, and
then a big spike in August as we added a few new people all at once.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl_ones.png" alt="img"></p>

<h1>Timebox</h1>

<p>Remember that hackathon project? I also wrote a Slack bot to categorize
meetings on my actual calendar, which is an interesting way of cross checking
my manual tracking. It&#39;s a little hard to parse, because the bot is designed
to report on one or two weeks at time. But you can see that while overall
meeting time has gone up, I&#39;ve actually been pretty successful at maintaining
and even increasing the amount of free time I have in blocks - time to actually
work on something substantial without interruptions.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/timebox_2017.jpeg" alt="img"></p>

<p>In fact, my time this year was 57% free time with 267 hours in blocks of at
least 3 hours. Doesn&#39;t sound too bad when you put it that way!</p>

<h1>RescueTime</h1>

<p>Finally, there is another fully automated time tracker that I started using
more recently called <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com">RescueTime</a>. It can give you
a breakdown of time spent by app/website. I&#39;m spending more time in Google
Spreadsheets than in my terminal app and my code editor combined, which is
definitely a strong signal.</p>
